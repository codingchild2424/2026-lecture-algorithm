# Part 2. What is an Algorithm?

Definition, Representation, and Key Concepts

---

# What is an Algorithm?

> A **systematic description** of a problem-solving procedure.

- Given an **input** (the problem), after a **finite number of steps**, it produces the desired **output** (the result).

```
┌─────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌──────────┐
│  Input   │ -> │    Algorithm    │ -> │  Output   │
│ (Problem)│    │ (finite steps)  │    │ (Result)  │
└─────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └──────────┘
```

**Requirements:**
- Clearly specify input and output
- The algorithm describes the process of transforming input into output

---

# Algorithm Example: Find the Maximum

**Problem:** Find the maximum value among 100 students' exam scores.

- **Input:** 100 exam scores
- **Output:** The maximum score

**Think:** What steps would you follow?

---

# Algorithm Example: Find the Maximum — Code

```python
def find_max(scores):
    max_val = scores[0]
    for i in range(1, len(scores)):
        if max_val < scores[i]:
            max_val = scores[i]
    return max_val
```

This is a simple but complete algorithm -- it has a clear input, a finite procedure, and a well-defined output.

---

# Algorithm Example: Sorting

**Problem:** Sort n integers in ascending order.

**Think:** Given `[64, 25, 12, 22, 11]`, how would you sort it step by step?

---

# Algorithm Example: Sorting — Selection Sort

```python
def selection_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        min_idx = i
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if arr[j] < arr[min_idx]:
                min_idx = j
        arr[i], arr[min_idx] = arr[min_idx], arr[i]
    return arr
```

```
Input:  [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]
Step 1: [11, 25, 12, 22, 64]   <- swap 64 and 11
Step 2: [11, 12, 25, 22, 64]   <- swap 25 and 12
Step 3: [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]   <- swap 25 and 22
Step 4: [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]   <- already in place
Output: [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]
```

# Algorithm vs Data Structure

| | Data Structure | Algorithm |
|---|---|---|
| **Question** | How to **store** information? | How to **solve** a problem? |
| **Analogy** | Parts and modules of a car | The method of building a car |
| **Prerequisites** | -- | Basic Programming, Data Structures |

<br>

> **Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs**
>
> -- Niklaus Wirth

**Example: English Dictionary**
- Unsorted words -> sequential search (slow)
- Sorted words -> binary search (fast)
- The **data structure** (sorted vs unsorted) determines which **algorithm** is efficient

# Part 3. First Steps in Algorithms

Classic Problems and Algorithmic Thinking

---

# Origin of the Word "Algorithm"

- The word **"algorithm"** comes from the 9th-century Persian mathematician **al-Khwarizmi**
- The **first known algorithm**: Euclid's GCD algorithm (~300 BC)
- Algorithms have been around for over **2,300 years** -- long before computers existed

**Question:** Given two numbers 48 and 18, how would you find their **Greatest Common Divisor**?

---

# Euclid's GCD Algorithm

**Idea:** Repeatedly replace the larger number with the remainder of dividing the two.

```python
def gcd(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
```

```
Example: gcd(48, 18)
  48, 18 -> 18, 12 -> 12, 6 -> 6, 0 -> return 6
```

Simple, finite, and correct -- the hallmarks of a good algorithm.

---

# 1.1 Finding the Maximum

**Problem:** Given cards with numbers face down, find the card with the largest number.

```
  ┌───┐ ┌───┐ ┌───┐ ┌───┐ ┌───┐ ┌───┐ ┌───┐
  │ ? │ │ ? │ │ ? │ │ ? │ │ ? │ │ ? │ │ ? │
  └───┘ └───┘ └───┘ └───┘ └───┘ └───┘ └───┘
```

**Think:** How would you find the largest number? What steps would you follow?

---

# 1.1 Finding the Maximum — Solution

**Approach:**
1. Look at the first card and remember its number
2. Look at the next card -- if it's larger, update the remembered number
3. Repeat until all cards are checked
4. The remembered number is the maximum

```python
def find_max(cards):
    max_val = cards[0]          # Step 1: remember first card
    for i in range(1, len(cards)):
        if cards[i] > max_val:  # Step 2: compare
            max_val = cards[i]  # update if larger
    return max_val              # Step 4: return the max
```

This is **sequential search** -- reading cards one by one in order.

---

# 1.2 Finding a Specific Number

**Problem:** Find the number **85** among these sorted cards.

```
 ┌────┐ ┌────┐ ┌────┐ ┌────┐ ┌────┐ ┌────┐ ┌────┐ ┌────┐ ┌────┐ ┌────┐
 │ 15 │ │ 20 │ │ 25 │ │ 35 │ │ 45 │ │ 55 │ │ 60 │ │ 75 │ │ 85 │ │ 90 │
 └────┘ └────┘ └────┘ └────┘ └────┘ └────┘ └────┘ └────┘ └────┘ └────┘
```

**Sequential Search** checks one by one: 15 → 20 → 25 → ... → 85. Takes **9 comparisons**.

**Think:** The data is **sorted**. Can we do better?

---

# 1.2 Binary Search — Key Insight

**Idea:** Compare with the **middle** element, then search only **one half**.

```
Search for 85 in: [15, 20, 25, 35, 45, 55, 60, 75, 85, 90]

Step 1: middle = 45  ->  85 > 45  ->  search right half
        [55, 60, 75, 85, 90]

Step 2: middle = 75  ->  85 > 75  ->  search right half
        [85, 90]

Step 3: middle = 85  ->  85 == 85 ->  FOUND!
```

Only **3 comparisons** instead of 9!

---

# 1.2 Binary Search — Code

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1

    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid              # Found!
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1          # Search right half
        else:
            right = mid - 1         # Search left half

    return -1                       # Not found
```

**Comparison:**

| Method | Sorted data required? | Worst case (n items) |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Sequential Search | No | n comparisons |
| Binary Search | Yes | log2(n) comparisons |

For n = 1,000,000: sequential = 1,000,000 vs binary = ~20

---

# 1.3 Coin Change Problem

**Problem:** Pay **730 won** in change using the **fewest coins** possible.

```
Available coins:

  ┌──────┐   ┌──────┐   ┌─────┐   ┌─────┐
  │ 500₩ │   │ 100₩ │   │ 50₩ │   │ 10₩ │
  └──────┘   └──────┘   └─────┘   └─────┘
```

**Think:** What strategy would you use to minimize the number of coins?

---

# 1.3 Coin Change — Greedy Solution

**Greedy approach:** Always pick the **largest** coin that doesn't exceed the remaining amount.

```
Remaining: 730
  -> 500₩ × 1  (remaining: 230)
  -> 100₩ × 2  (remaining:  30)
  ->  10₩ × 3  (remaining:   0)

Total coins: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 coins (minimum!)
```

---

# 1.3 Coin Change — Code

> **Greedy Algorithm:** At each step, make the **locally optimal choice** hoping it leads to a **globally optimal solution**.

```python
def coin_change(amount, coins=[500, 100, 50, 10]):
    result = []
    for coin in coins:                # coins sorted descending
        count = amount // coin
        if count > 0:
            result.append((coin, count))
            amount -= coin * count
    return result

# coin_change(730) -> [(500, 1), (100, 2), (10, 3)]
```

**Important question:** How can we **guarantee** this greedy approach always gives the minimum?
- We'll study this rigorously in **Chapter 4 (Greedy Algorithms)**

---

# 1.4 Euler Path (One-Stroke Drawing)

**Problem:** Starting from a vertex, traverse **every edge exactly once** and return to the starting vertex. Vertices may be revisited.

```
    1 ─── 2
    │╲   ╱│ │
    │  ╳  │ │
    │╱   ╲│ │
    4 ─── 3
```

**Think:** Can you draw this graph in **one stroke** without lifting your pen? Try it!

---

# 1.4 Euler Path — The Key Insight

When at a vertex with multiple choices, which edge should we pick?

**The rule:** Move to a neighbor only if there is a **cycle** back to the current vertex through that neighbor. Avoid **bridges** (edges whose removal disconnects the graph).

**Example:** At vertex 7, should we go to 6, 9, or 10?
- Vertex 6: cycle exists back through 5, 4, 3, 9, 7 → **safe**
- Vertex 9: cycle exists back through 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 → **safe**
- Vertex 10: only leads to vertex 1, no cycle back → **dead end**

**Algorithm:**
1. If there is only one adjacent unvisited edge (a "bridge"), take it
2. Otherwise, move to a neighbor through which a **cycle** exists back to the current vertex

Cycle detection can be done using **Depth First Search (DFS)**.

---

# 1.5 Maze Solving

**The Greek myth of Theseus:** He entered the Labyrinth with a **ball of thread** to find his way back.

```
  ┌───┬───────┬───┐
  │ S │       │   │
  │   └──╴╶──┘   │
  │   ┌───┐      │
  ├───┘   └──┐   │
  │          │   │
  │   ┌──────┘   │
  │   │       E  │
  └───┴──────────┘
```

**Think:** Without a thread or map, how would you **guarantee** finding the exit?

---

# 1.5 Maze Solving — Right-Hand Rule

**Right-Hand Rule:**
1. Place your right hand on the wall
2. Walk forward, never lifting your right hand from the wall
3. You will **always** reach the exit

This works without any markers or threads -- a simple, elegant algorithm.

**Why does it work?** The wall is one connected boundary. By following it, you are guaranteed to trace the entire boundary, which includes the exit.

---

# 1.6 Fake Coin Problem

**Problem:** Among n coins, **one** is counterfeit (slightly lighter). Find it using a **balance scale** with the minimum number of weighings.

```
   Real coins         Fake coin (lighter)
  ┌──┐┌──┐┌──┐       ┌──┐
  │10│││10│││10│       │ 9│
  └──┘└──┘└──┘       └──┘

        ┌─────────────────┐
        │    ╱─────╲      │
    ────┤   ╱       ╲     ├────
        │  ╱  scale  ╲    │
        └─────────────────┘
```

**Think:** What strategy minimizes the number of weighings for **1,024 coins**?

---

# 1.6 Fake Coin — Three Approaches

| Approach | Method | Worst case (n coins) |
|----------|--------|---------------------|
| **Approach A** | Compare one coin against each other | n - 1 |
| **Approach B** | Compare coins in pairs | n / 2 |
| **Approach C** | Divide pile in half, weigh halves | log2(n) |

---

# Fake Coin — Approach A (One by One)

Place one coin on the left side, then try each remaining coin on the right.

```
Coin 1 vs Coin 2  ->  balanced
Coin 1 vs Coin 3  ->  balanced
Coin 1 vs Coin 4  ->  balanced
  ...
Coin 1 vs Coin k  ->  LIGHTER! (Coin k is fake)
```

- **Best case:** 1 weighing (lucky)
- **Worst case:** n - 1 weighings
- For 1,024 coins: up to **1,023** weighings

---

# Fake Coin — Approach B (Pairs)

Pair up coins and weigh each pair.

```
(Coin 1, Coin 2)  ->  balanced (both real)
(Coin 3, Coin 4)  ->  balanced (both real)
  ...
(Coin k, Coin k+1) -> UNBALANCED! (one of these is fake)
```

- **Worst case:** n / 2 weighings
- For 1,024 coins: up to **512** weighings
- Better, but still linear

---

# Fake Coin — Approach C (Divide in Half)

Split the pile in half, weigh the two halves. The lighter half contains the fake.

```
n = 1024 coins

Step 1:  512 vs 512  ->  left is lighter
Step 2:  256 vs 256  ->  right is lighter
Step 3:  128 vs 128  ->  left is lighter
  ...
Step 10:   1 vs   1  ->  left is lighter -> FOUND!
```

- **Always** log2(n) weighings
- For 1,024 coins: exactly **10** weighings

This is the **Divide and Conquer** strategy -- we'll study it in depth in **Chapter 3**.

---

# Fake Coin — Comparison

For n = 1,024 coins:

| Approach | Worst case | Strategy |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| A (one by one) | **1,023** | Brute force |
| B (pairs) | **512** | Slightly smarter |
| C (halving) | **10** | Divide and Conquer |

**Why is Approach C so much better?**
- Each weighing **eliminates half** the remaining coins
- The number of weighings = log2(n)

> The **log function** is crucial in algorithm analysis. Remember it!

---

# 1.7 Poisoned Wine Problem

**Story:** A king has many wine jars. A spy poisoned **exactly one** jar. The poison kills exactly **one week** after tasting, even from a tiny sip.

```
  🍷🍷🍷🍷🍷🍷🍷🍷
  🍷🍷🍷🍷☠️🍷🍷🍷    ← one is poisoned!
  🍷🍷🍷🍷🍷🍷🍷🍷
```

**The king's order:**
- Find the poisoned jar in **exactly one week**
- **Minimize** the number of servants who must taste

**Think:** For **8 jars**, how many servants do you need? What about **1,000 jars**?

---

# Poisoned Wine — Small Cases

**2 jars, 1 servant:**

| Servant tastes jar... | If servant dies | If servant lives |
|----------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Jar 1 | Jar 1 is poisoned | Jar 2 is poisoned |

1 servant can identify the poisoned jar among **2** jars.

---

# Poisoned Wine — 4 Jars

**First attempt:** 3 servants each taste 1 jar -> works but uses 3 servants.

**Can we do it with 2 servants?**

Assign each jar a 2-bit binary number:

| Jar | Binary | Servant A tastes? | Servant B tastes? |
|-----|--------|------------------|------------------|
| 0 | 00 | No | No |
| 1 | 01 | No | Yes |
| 2 | 10 | Yes | No |
| 3 | 11 | Yes | Yes |

**Rule:** Servant A tastes jars where **bit 1 = 1**. Servant B tastes jars where **bit 0 = 1**.

---

# Poisoned Wine — Reading the Result

After one week, check who died:

| A dies? | B dies? | Binary | Poisoned jar |
|---------|---------|--------|-------------|
| No | No | 00 | Jar 0 |
| No | Yes | 01 | Jar 1 |
| Yes | No | 10 | Jar 2 |
| Yes | Yes | 11 | Jar 3 |

The **death pattern** directly encodes the **binary number** of the poisoned jar!

---

# Poisoned Wine — 8 Jars (3 Servants)

| Jar | Binary | A tastes? | B tastes? | C tastes? |
|-----|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| 0 | 000 | No | No | No |
| 1 | 001 | No | No | Yes |
| 2 | 010 | No | Yes | No |
| 3 | 011 | No | Yes | Yes |
| 4 | 100 | Yes | No | No |
| 5 | 101 | Yes | No | Yes |
| 6 | 110 | Yes | Yes | No |
| 7 | 111 | Yes | Yes | Yes |

Each servant tastes **4 jars**. If jar 7 is poisoned, **all 3 die** (111).

---

# Poisoned Wine — General Solution

**For n jars:**
- Number of servants needed = **log2(n)**
- Each jar is assigned a unique binary number (0 to n-1)
- Servant k tastes all jars where the k-th bit is 1
- After one week, the binary pattern of dead servants = the poisoned jar's number

```
n = 1000 jars  ->  log2(1000) = ~10 servants
n = 1,000,000  ->  log2(1,000,000) = ~20 servants
```

This is the power of **binary encoding** -- a fundamentally different way of thinking.

---

# Summary

| Problem | Algorithm / Strategy | Key Concept |
|---------|---------------------|-------------|
| Finding max | Scan all elements | Sequential Search |
| Finding a target | Divide sorted data in half | Binary Search |
| Coin change | Pick largest coin first | Greedy (Ch. 4) |
| Euler path | Follow cycles, avoid bridges | Euler Circuit / DFS |
| Fake coin | Split pile in half | Divide and Conquer (Ch. 3) |
| Poisoned wine | Binary number assignment | Binary Encoding |

**Recurring theme:** The **log2(n)** function appears in binary search, fake coin, and poisoned wine. Algorithms that reduce the problem size by half at each step achieve **logarithmic** performance.
